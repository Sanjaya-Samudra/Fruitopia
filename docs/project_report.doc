1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fruitopia is a small, full-stack project which provides fruit recommendations and a vision-based fruit classifier demo. During this development session we stabilized the integration between the Angular frontend and the FastAPI backend, implemented developer-friendly fallbacks to support UI testing while models are being developed, and fixed several runtime and TypeScript issues that prevented a smooth demo.

Key outcomes:
- Fixed frontend TypeScript issues and added a typed `FruitService`.
- Resolved 422 multipart errors by aligning frontend form field names with backend expectations.
- Implemented a tolerant and layered `/vision/predict` backend that: attempts to use a saved PyTorch model (if present); falls back to a local helper `identify_fruit`; falls back to a deterministic dev mock controlled with `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT` in `backend/.env`.
- Added a safe `.env` loader and startup logging to make local configuration reliable.
- Produced a QA report (this document) describing the changes, how to verify them, and next steps.

2. INTRODUCTION

This report documents the development and QA work performed during the Fruitopia session dated 2025-10-10. The goal was to build a working developer experience for the app where the frontend and backend are tightly integrated, the vision prediction endpoint can be used during development even if a model is not available, and core user flows (recommendation and fruit detail pages) are stable.

Audience: project stakeholders, instructors, and maintainers who need a complete, accurate description of the work and how to verify it.

************************************************************************
3. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES

Problems observed before work began:
- Frontend TypeScript errors prevented a clean build and blocked UI progress.
- Vision prediction calls returned 422 or 501 responses due to a multipart field mismatch and missing model artifacts.
- The backend import-time crashed with a NameError due to an environment file loader referencing variables declared later.
- There was no reliable, opt-in developer mock for predictions to test the UI while model follow-up work occurs.

Objectives for this session:
- Fix TypeScript issues and missing frontend service imports.
- Make `/vision/predict` work during development: accept file uploads, support existing model inference, and offer a dev mock fallback.
- Ensure server starts even when optional heavy libraries (torch) are not installed.
- Add documentation and easy, repeatable verification steps for demoing the app.

************************************************************************
4. DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

4.1 Architecture overview
The project is an Angular frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- Frontend (Angular): components for recommendations, gallery, and fruit details. HTTP calls are made to relative paths and proxied to the backend in dev (`proxy.conf.json`).
- Backend (FastAPI): endpoints for recommendations (`/recommend`), vision (`/vision/*`), and fruit details (`/fruit/{name}/detail`). The backend contains an ML folder for model artifacts and small heuristics (recommender JSON files).

4.2 Backend changes and rationale
File: `backend/vision_api.py` — central backend module
- Fixed import-order bug: moved `.env` loader below `FILE_DIR` definition to avoid NameError.
- Added `.env` loader: reads simple KEY=VALUE pairs from `backend/.env` for local development. This is optional and preserves environment precedence.
- Added startup logging (logger.info) to show whether `.env` is read and the value of `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT`.
- Implemented `_ensure_model()` lazy loader:
  - Looks for `ml/models/fruit_classifier.pt` (the standard model path used by `ml/train.py`).
  - Attempts to load the model using PyTorch and torchvision only if they are present.
  - Keeps loading failures silent (server still runs without torch).
- Extended `/vision/predict` endpoint to follow this layered flow:
  1. save the uploaded file to `backend/tmp` (temporary storage)
  2. try using loaded PyTorch model (if `_ensure_model()` loaded it)
  3. if no model or inference fails, import and call `vision.image_recognition.identify_fruit` if available
  4. if that fails and `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT` is enabled, return deterministic dev mock
  5. otherwise return 501 Not Implemented
- Extended `/vision/health` to set `model_loaded` when a model file exists or identify helper is importable.
- Added logging to surface model-loading success/failure and prediction errors.

Design rationale:
- Lazy model loading prevents import-time errors if heavy dependencies are missing.
- Layered fallback allows the UI to be tested in many environments: fully model-enabled, helper-enabled, or dev-mock-only.

4.3 Frontend changes and rationale
- Added `frontend/src/app/services/fruit.service.ts` — typed `FruitService` exposing `getDetail()`.
- Fixed `fruit-detail.component.ts` to import `FruitService` and type the subscribe callback (fixes implicit-any TypeScript error).
- Updated `frontend/src/app/services/vision.service.ts` to append the file under key `file` in FormData (aligns with backend UploadFile parameter). The backend was also made tolerant to `image` field name for compatibility.

4.4 Dev tooling, env and model handling
- `backend/.env.example` added documenting `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT` and `USDA_API_KEY`.
- Dev mock: set `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT=1` in `backend/.env` to receive predictable fake predictions (useful for UI demo without a model).

4.5 Data and ML artifacts
- Training artifacts are saved under `ml/models` per `ml/train.py`.
- The loader expects the saved checkpoint to be a python dict (torch.save) containing `{'model_state': ..., 'classes': [...]}` — this is consistent with `ml/train.py` in the repo.

************************************************************************
5. ENDPOINTS AND CONTRACT

Key endpoints used by the frontend and their shapes:

- GET /recommend/diseases
  - Response: { "diseases": ["anemia","diabetes",...] }

- POST /recommend
  - Request JSON: { "disease":"diabetes", "have": ["apple"] }
  - Response JSON: { "recommendations": [...], "disease": "diabetes" }

- GET /vision/health
  - Response: { "ok": true, "model_loaded": true|false }

- POST /vision/predict
  - Request: multipart/form-data with field `file` (file upload). Backend also accepts `image` for compatibility.
  - Response: (examples)
    - model path: {"predictions":[{"class":"apple","score":0.87}, ...], "source":"torch-model"}
    - helper path: {"predictions":[...], "source":"local-identify"}
    - dev mock: {"predictions":[...], "source":"dev-mock"}
    - if nothing: 501 Not Implemented JSON

- GET /vision/classes
  - Response: { "classes": ["apple","banana", ...] }

- GET /vision/samples?cls=Apple&n=6
  - Response: { "samples": ["img1.jpg", ...] }

- GET /vision/image?cls=Apple&file=img1.jpg
  - Response: FileResponse with the image binary

- GET /fruit/{name}/detail
  - Phase A: returns fallback or cached fruit details. Phase B (planned) calls USDA FoodData Central when API key present.

************************************************************************
6. TESTING, EVALUATION & QA STEPS

Manual verification steps (smoke tests):

1) Backend startup (PowerShell):
   cd E:\Sanjaya\MyProjects\Fruitopia
   uvicorn backend.vision_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

   - Verify startup logs include: "vision_api startup - backend/.env loaded=... - BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT=..."
   - If a model file exists, you should see: "_ensure_model: loaded model from ..."

2) Health check:
   Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/vision/health

3) Predict with a file (PowerShell example):
   $fp = 'C:\path\to\test.jpg'
   $body = @{ file = Get-Item $fp }
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/vision/predict -Method Post -Form $body

   - Expected: JSON with predictions from model/helper/dev-mock depending on environment and artifacts.

4) Frontend checks:
   cd frontend
   ng serve --configuration development --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
   - Visit the UI, try the prediction upload or explore a class and verify fruit detail page loads.

Automated tests (recommended):
- Add a simple pytest or request-based test to POST a small image file and assert a 200 and expected keys in response (using dev-mock during CI).

************************************************************************
7. RESULTS AND VERIFICATION

What has been verified during development:
- Fixed the TypeScript import error and implicit-any in `fruit-detail.component.ts`.
- Handled multipart mismatches and eliminated 422 errors by aligning frontend and backend field names.
- Implemented and validated the dev mock: when `BACKEND_FAKE_PREDICT` is set, `POST /vision/predict` returns a deterministic payload.
- Implemented lazy model loader — server starts without torch and falls back cleanly.

Sample outputs observed (examples):
- GET /recommend/diseases -> {"diseases":["anemia","constipation","diabetes","general","hypertension"]}
- POST /vision/predict (dev mock) -> {"predictions":[{"class":"apple","score":0.87},{"class":"banana","score":0.08}],"source":"dev-mock"}

************************************************************************
8. LIMITATIONS & KNOWN ISSUES

- Model file format: loader expects checkpoint format saved by `ml/train.py` (dict with `model_state` & `classes`). If your model uses another format, adapt `_ensure_model()` accordingly.
- Torch and torchvision are optional; if not installed, real model inference won't run. Installing them is required for real predictions.
- `vision/image_recognition.py` in the repo is a placeholder returning 'apple' by default. If previously you had a custom implementation there, ensure it remains present.
- The dev mock is deterministic and simplified; not a substitute for real inference.
- Frontend dev server must use `proxy.conf.json` to route relative API calls to the backend (typical Angular dev setup).

************************************************************************
9. RECOMMENDATIONS & NEXT STEPS

Priority next steps (deliverables for a polished demo):
1) Confirm or copy the trained model to `ml/models/fruit_classifier.pt` and install PyTorch.
2) Add small unit tests for the backend endpoints and a CI job that runs them.
3) Implement Phase B USDA integration behind `USDA_API_KEY` in `.env` and add caching + normalization.
4) Add a feedback endpoint in backend and UI buttons (thumbs up/down) to collect training data.
5) Improve the `identify_fruit` module to be a thin wrapper around the same PyTorch model loader so only a single inference pathway exists.

Optional UX polish:
- Add a prettier dev mock with varied outputs (top-3 realistic classes), sample images and latency simulation to test UI states.
- Create a status panel in the UI that shows `vision/health` and model version/class count.
